# This file keeps the demo-video folder in git
# Upload your demo video files here (MP4, MOV, etc.)
# Then get the raw GitHub URL and update the main README 

# Demo Video Directory
# 
# This directory is for demo video files
# 
# Note: Large video files (>50MB) should be:
# 1. Hosted externally (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.)
# 2. Or use Git LFS if needed in repository
# 
# Current demo video: demoCashi.mov (97MB) - too large for GitHub
# Recommended: Upload to video hosting platform and link in README.md
